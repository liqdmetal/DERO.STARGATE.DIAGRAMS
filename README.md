Dero Stargate network Process Diagrams
I have created this process diagram repository in order to collaboratively create process flow diagrams showing how exactly the DEROHE Stargate Network and the DHEBP work.
The intent is to have several diagrams starting with the Layer 1 network itself and how it works. Future considerations will include interchain operations and layer 2.
I hope that this process will allow an easier way to explain to new comers to DERO how precisely Dero network functions on a technical way but alsobe understood by laymen.
Dero network has the technicaly capacity to replace centralized information technology platforms in a secure, decentralized and private manner. This repository is created to help brainstorm and diagram how Dero network will accomplish this.
