# DERO.STARGATE.DIAGRAMS
Dero Stargate network Process Diagrams
I have created this process diagram repository in order to collaboratively create process flow diagrams showing how exactly the DEROHE Stargate Network and the DHEBP work.
The intent is to have several diagrams starting with the Layer 1 network itself and how it works. 
I hope that this process will enable easy explanation to new comers as to how DERO functions on a technical level but also be easily understood by laymen.
Dero network has the technicaly capacity to replace centralized information technology platforms in a secure, decentralized and private manner. This repository is created to help brainstorm and diagram how Dero network will accomplish this.
Future considerations will include current and experimental interchain operations as well as Dero layer 2 applications.
